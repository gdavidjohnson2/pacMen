## Description

The html file features three buttons to create and animate the iconic pacman. Multiple pacman images can be generated at with random directions and speeds, the last pacman in the series can be removed, or the images can be reset in order to start over. 

## How to Run

Clone the Repository or download to your local machine. Open the index.html file in your browser. 

* Click **Add PacMan** to add as many pacmen as you would like (or system will allow)
* Click **Remove a PacMan** to remove the last PacMan that was added
* Click **Start Game** to begin the animation
    - **Start Game** becomes **Reset Game** once it has been clicked
    - **Reset Game** will remove all pacmen and stop the animations until **Start Game** has been clicked and additonal pacmen have been added

***Both*** *Add PacMan* ***and*** *Remove a Pacman* ***can still be clicked while the animation is active***

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

* Add Ghosts
* Add collision detection
* Add Power Pellets
* Add Interaction with Ghosts on power up via Power Pellets
* Add **Game Over** image on **Reset Game**
